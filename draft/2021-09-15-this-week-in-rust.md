## Crate of the Week

Sadly, we had no nominations this week. Still, in the spirit of not leaving you without some neat rust code, I give you [gradient](https://github.com/mazznoer/gradient-rs), a command line tool to extract gradients from SVG, display and manipulate them.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!
